    <p>the following note was written exactly two years ago today. I was on a bus ride back home, but I didn't really plan on getting there. this was the first time I truly had the intention to end my own life.</p>
    <p>nobody else was supposed to read it, I already had a public one scheduled for a few days after the fact. but after rediscovering it, I feel it carries a unique insight into the suicidal experience. I exhibited many of the common thought patterns, feelings of finality and fate, cognitive distortions and strange beliefs observed by those in crisis.</p>
    <p>it could be considered somewhat funny that I had no idea how much worse it could possibly get.</p>

    <p>I think it's time. I haven't spoken to anyone else today, nobody would speak to me either. nobody has even noticed. I thought today would have been meaningful, or that I would have more to say in the event it didn't. I shouldn't have expected as much, I suppose. there's no point in assuming reality would be any less condescending and cruel after so many years of persisting here.</p>
    <p>it has all led to today. I guess every second of pain and suffering, trying to endure and failing, everything I have done throughout my entire life ends here, on a random Thursday afternoon. I'm at peace with that, though. I won't have to deal with any of it anymore. true peace is around the corner. now, all I have left are wishes.</p>
    <p>I wish I made something of my life. I wish I wasn't so sick, or that I could remember what it's like to not be in constant pain. I wish I could start over, and have spoken up for myself at the right moments. I wish I wasn't constantly tortured, corrupted or fogged.</p>
    <p>I wish I could have done all that I was supposed to do. I wish I were the person I would have become if none of this had happened.</p>
    <p>I hope everyone will understand why I did this.</p>
    <p>I hope everyone will forgive me.</p>
    <p>I hope I succeed today.</p>
