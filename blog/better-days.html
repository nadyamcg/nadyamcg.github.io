<h2 class="blog-title">have I seen better days?</h2>

<div class="note blog-content">
    <p>the idiom <b>"I've seen better days"</b> comes up in casual conversation a lot. for me, I heard it while I was on suicide watch last week. another psych patient said it while we ate lunch together. I've heard this phrase a lot before, but this was different. I could tell <b><i>exactly</i></b> what they meant, and I can't stop thinking about it.</p>
    <p>we usually associate the phrase with being simply discontent, your coworker or family member may say it for various reasons (fatigue, work-life balance, disappointment, etc), but it's rarely given a second thought, like most idioms. to me, it's a phrase that, when thought out, speaks a very specific kind of suffering.</p>
    <p>the quote dates back to the Shakespearean era of the late 16th century. it doesn't originate from Shakespeare's solo works, but in the collaborative play <em>Sir Thomas More</em> (circa 1590). here, a character laments, “<b>Having seen better days</b>, now know the lack of glory that once reared each high-fed back.” Shakespeare later reused the phrase in <em>Timon of Athens</em> (act IV, scene II), when Flavius laments the downfall of his once-prosperous master: “Let's shake our heads, and say, as ’twere a knell unto our master's fortunes, <b>‘we have seen better days.’</b>” it appears again in <em>As You Like It</em> (act II, scene VII), spoken by Duke Senior, where he recalls his past as a ruler before he was exiled by his brother.</p>
    <p>the first uses of the phrase were in the context of people who once had everything, wealth, power, and peace, to having nothing. over centuries, its meaning has changed. repetition has softened it into a common idiom. most people today use it as short for "I'm feeling not great, but let's not get into it." they are voicing distress in a way that is socially acceptable — <b>a one-liner</b>.</p>
    <p>to me, the roots of the phrase carry a much deeper ache; the realization that the person you once were has been gone for a long time now. something inside has decayed. you have known what it means to be whole, and now feel nothing but its loss. <b>"I once had a life worth something, and now I am standing in its ruins."</b> we have decided over time to reduce this phrase to have <i>just enough</i> of a bite to communicate despair, but in a controlled, "polite" way. this way, you can say "I'm not okay" without having to confront the weight of it, and get maybe get some platitudes and performed sympathy out of it. <b>you can be sad, but you can never be vulnerable.</b></p>
    <p>if it cannot be softened to the point of being meaningless, it will be too taboo to say out loud; in public or in private. most of our social activity and entertainment is on phones and computers, everyone is guided by an algorithm. they are designed for the sole purpose of getting as much information as possible from you, and selling that data to the highest bidder to serve ads. advertisers do not like it if their ads are on content considered controversial or "promoting harm." to protect ad revenue, YouTube and TikTok began banning specific words from being said at all, shadowbanning people who say the wrong things. <b>this is censorship</b>.</p>
    <p>censorship will never magically stop all discussion on any given topic, people will simply find alternatives around it. suicide becomes "unalive," "self-deletion" or "sewerslide." a gun is a "pew pew," a sexual assault is a "grape," a "psych ward" is a "grippy sock vacation." while sometimes amusing, this slang was created so people can continue to create as they always have been, but the majority still get shadowbanned, subtly automoderated into obscurity. and suicidal people get isolated further. unable express themselves, or to see anyone like them. <b>we are on our own.</b> is acknowledging that suicide exists "promoting harm?" should these people be treated as if they were posting racial slurs? where do they go when they have been removed from the public space?</p>
    <p>there are always worse places to be, online. communities can form from every interest or common factor that can be thought of. <b>when people are systematically silenced on mainstream platforms, they will always seek alternatives.</b> we have seen time and time again, entirely prohibiting discussion on a topic does not remove the need for it, and softening the language of suffering will highlight the spaces that refuse to do so. there, in the unmoderated and dark corners of the open internet, suicidal people will find communities that do not shy away from the graphic reality of their suffering; echo chambers designed by and for those in despair. these spaces speak their language, and offer the validation that others have denied them. in seeking refuge, they will find a culture of encouragement, one that often serves not to pull them back from the edge, but to rationalize stepping over it. in the places where it is most necessary, <b>they will not censor the detailed methods by which one may take their own life.</b></p>
    <p>I believe there are consequences for neutering how humans are allowed to express their discontentment, sadness, or depression. I am not saying it should be expected or well-received to traumadump on everybody or at the wrong times. but when our words are being taken from us by algorithms designed to only promote what increases ad revenue, and entire quotes are stripped of all meaning, <b>censorship changes the way we talk</b>. what will happen when language loses the ability to hold real pain? when people do not have the words to explain why they no longer feel whole, something eventually has to break. it will never be algorithms or society.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>earliest print</b>: the line appears in the collaborative play <em>Sir Thomas More</em> (c. 1590): “hauing seene better dayes, now know the lack / of glorie…” - a lament for people fallen from prosperity.</li>
    <li><b>Shakespeare uses it twice</b>: <em>As You Like It</em> (II.7) where Duke Senior recalls a better past; and <em>Timon of Athens</em> (IV.2) where Flavius mourns the ruin of a noble house.</li>
    <li><b>modern drift</b>: often applied to anything, worn‑down objects as much as people.</li>
