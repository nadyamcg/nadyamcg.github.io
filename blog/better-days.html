<h2>have i seen better days?</h2>
<p>the idiom "I've seen better days" comes up in casual conversation a lot. 
    your coworker or family member may say it for various reasons (fatigue, work-life balance, disappointment, etc). 
    this phrase is often thrown out casually, but is rarely thought about. as with most idioms, it's a quote that, when thought out,
    speaks a very specific kind of suffering. over centuries, repetition has softened it into common one-liner. most people today
    it as short for "I'm feeling not great, but let's not get into it."</p>
<p>when you hear someone say it now, they are voicing distress in a way that is socially acceptable. to me, the roots of the 
    phrase carry a much deeper ache; the realization that the person you once were has been gone for a long time now.
    something inside has decayed. that you have known what it means to be whole, and now feel its loss. "I once had a life worth something,
    and now I am standing in its ruins." we have decided over time to reduce this phrase, to have just enough of a bite to communicate despair
    in a controlled, "polite" way. this way, you can say "I'm not okay" without having to confront the weight of it, and get platitudes and performed sympathy.
    you can be sad, but you can never be vulnerable.</p>
<p>I believe there are consequences by neutering how humans are allowed to express their discontentment, depression, or sadness. I am not saying
    it should be expected or well-received to traumadump on everybody and at the wrong times. but when our words are being taken from us by algorithms
    designed to only promote what increases ad revenue, and entire quotes are stripped of all meaning, censorship changes the way we talk.
    what will happen when language loses the ability to hold real pain? when people do not have the words to explain why they no longer feel whole, 
    something eventually has to break. it will never be algorithms or society.
